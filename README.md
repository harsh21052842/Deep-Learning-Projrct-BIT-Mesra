This project comprises two essential stages aimed at harnessing wind energy for power generation. The first stage involves the utilization of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict wind speeds. This predictive
model is trained using a CSV file named "RNN_Training (Wind Speed)," which contains historical data on wind speeds. The RNN is designed to analyze patterns and correlations within the data to make accurate 
predictions about future wind speeds. Upon successfully predicting wind speeds in the first stage, the project seamlessly transitions to the second stage. In this subsequent phase, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
model is employed to establish a meaningful relationship between the predicted wind speeds and power generation. This ANN model is trained using historical data that correlates wind speeds to power generated.The 
goal of the second stage is to enable the system to autonomously calculate the power generated based on the manually entered predicted wind speeds. By leveraging the learned relationships from past data, the ANN 
model optimizes its ability to accurately estimate the power output corresponding to the given wind conditions. In summary, the two stages of the project work in tandem: the RNN predicts wind speeds, and the ANN 
leverages this information to establish a predictive model for power generation. This holistic approach aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of wind energy conversion, contributing to sustainable and 
effective renewable energy solutions.
